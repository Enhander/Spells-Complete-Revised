### What Are The Spell Revisions?

The full changelog is viewable as a webpage <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/WvQGyVQPPkNg">here</a>.

### Who Are These Change Intended For?

These changes were balance changes that I made for my D&D group.  Feel free to use, discard, or modify these changes however makes your game better for your group.

### What Should I Expect These Revisions To Do To My Game's Balance Generally?

In general, these changes as a stand-alone revision will increase caster/half-caster power, and may widen the martial-caster disparity in T3/T4 of gameplay if not accompanied with other homebrew elements that aim to close that gap.  

Most changes buff spells that my I/my group felt were underpowered or were too niche to justify a spell list slot.  In particular, many concentration spells also become stronger with the new _channeling_ mechanic, so expect some power creep there as well.

Additioanlly, many ritual tags were added with the caveat of using gold-costed components if cast as a ritual.  This may affect the balance of your game depending on your game's specific economy, so feel free to modify these according to your own game's economy to whatever feels right.

There are a select few changes which nerf spells.  The spells which receive nerfs are Counterspell, and any resurrection-type spell.  **The resurrection spell changes are a modified form of the ones Matthew Mercer uses for Critical Role (credit to him).**

Since these are spell changes and not class/subclass changes however, remember that NPCs/Monsters also have access to these changes and may change in power accordingly.
As with all hombrew content, **do what works for your group to have the most fun**.

### What Are The Author's Intentions With These Changes?

The overarching motivation for most of these spell changes was to bring underpicked/underused spells up to parity with commonly chosen/used spells.  **In my play group** I noticed certain spells being chosen more often than others, whether that was because they had mutual exclusivity through the _concentration_ tag, they were underpowered compared to other similar spells (numbers-wise), or they were too niche to justify a spell list slot.

The channeling keyword addition in particular aims to alleviate some spell choice dilemmas by allowing some of the weaker/niche concentration spells to not compete with the more staple/universal concentration spells for spell list slots or spell slots.  Overall, this does increase the power of those spells.

Many ritual tags were added to better incentivize the _Ritual Caster_ feature, and generally was added for some parity between spells which lore-wise, my group felt should be ritual spells.  These changes allow a caster to ritual cast some spells in exchange for paying gold-costed material components (i.e., trading money for the use of a spell slot).  We also just wanted more ritual spells in the game, cause we feel they are cool.

The resurrection spell changes were added to give death more weight in the world in later tiers of the game, and to add some more roleplaying elements to death.  They specifically include DM fiat clauses to allow for some leeway when a DM feels a PC deserves/should come back to life, or otherwise.  Again, it should be noted that these changes primarily come from Matthew Mercer's resurrection spell rules that he uses on Critical Role, although they have been slightly modified here.

Other changes generally either aim to change the mechanics of a spell to fit its head-canon flavor better, or to give it some more distinction from other similar spells.

### Why Did You Nerf Counterspell?

The nerf to counterspell was intended to deter caster slot-burn attrition, wherein two or more casters with Counterspell would continually burn spell slots on Counterspell to stop each other's spells from going off entirely, until one of them ran out of resources.  I find that this is not a fun situation, as both casters simply have to burn through resources until one of them can "start doing something", and it can extend combat unnecessarily at times.  However, I wanted to keep the situation where a caster saves their Counterspell for a critical moment and uses it to change the course of a battle.  The result was this nerf to counterspell.

That being said, if you enjoy counterspell in its original form, feel free to ignore this change entirely!  Do what works for your group.

### Do You Intend To Make A Compendium With All Spells RAW?

The short answer is no.  The long answer is that it already took me a long time to make this compendium, and in hindsight while I could have added a RAW version of each spell into the compendium as well, I did not.  If you wish to do this using this compendium as a base, feel free to do so.

### What do these (CA) and (HB) Tags Mean?

They were intended as tags for my players to identify spells which had been changed (HB, for Home Brew) or had their availability to classes changed (CA, for Class Availability).  I did not get through changing all of the spells' class availabilities, which is why those tags stop at a certain point in the list alphabetically.  Feel free to ignore the CA changes entirely, as I didn't really give enough thought into them.

### I Dislike These Changes

That's fine.  Don't use them and do what works for your group!

### I Have A Question/I Feel The Change to X Spell Could Be Better

I'd be happy to hear constructive feedback on these changes, and even engage in some balance debates as long as it's all respectful.  Ultimately, I may decide to change my mind about the changes, or I might stick with them.  Feel free to open an issue here for discussion.
